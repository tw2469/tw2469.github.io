## About
I am a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Xiasong Li's group at University of Washington. I will share my research progress and some tutorials in this personal website.

## Research Interest
### DFT for Heterogeneous Catalysis.
*	DFT for NORR, H2-SCR, and NH3 oxidation reactions: discover the favored reaction pathway, transition states, and rate determine steps (RDS).
*	Design high throughput scanning for the full adsorption potential energy surface (PES).
*	Design automated pipeline: DFT input → searching optimum adsorption sites → determine reaction pathway → post-analysis of electronic structures.

### Machine Learning and Design of Metal Organic Framework (MOF).
*	Design and distribute high throughput calculation for absorption spectra at independent particle approximation (IPA) level.
*	Manage the DFT generated data: error handling, data extraction, and analysis for large simulation campaigns. Correct the systematic originated from spin-polarization.
*	Train the machine learning model using Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNN). Predict the visible light absorption ability based on crystal structure information.

### Computational Spectroscopy.
*	State-of-art methods to account for the relativistic effect on spectroscopy (e.g. spin-orbital coupling): two component X2C Hamiltonian combined with TDDFT, CASSCF, and RASCI.
*	Resolve the fine structure of EUV and XAS spectra.

### Calculations of Semiconductors for the application of LED and Solar Cells.
*	Halide perovskite for the application of LED and solar cells.
*	Determine organic ligands for the passivation application and the optimum material stability.
*	Simulation of III-V core-shell semiconductors nanocrystals.
