abstract  ="An acid-resistant catalyst composed of nickel embedded in N-doped porous carbon is developed for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (NB) to p-aminophenol (PAP). The catalyst{,} due to a special electron donation from nickel to the N-doped porous carbon{,} shows an excellent catalytic performance and stability in sulphuric acid solution."}
