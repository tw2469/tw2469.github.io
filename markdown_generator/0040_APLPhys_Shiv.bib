    abstract = {Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is a striking quantum phenomenon in which electron transport through chiral molecules leads to spin polarization—even in the absence of external magnetic fields or magnetic components. Although observed in systems such as DNA, helicenes, proteins, and polymers, the fundamental physical origin of CISS remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a time-dependent relativistic four-current framework, in which charge and current densities evolve according to the time-dependent variational principle. Real-time relativistic four-current simulations enable direct analysis of helical currents and induced magnetization dynamics. Applied to helicenes—axially chiral molecules lacking stereocenters—our simulations reveal curvature-induced helical electron currents that generate spontaneous magnetic fields aligned along the molecular axis. These fields are handedness-dependent and reach magnitudes of 10−1 T per single helicene strand. Our results suggest that CISS may arise from intrinsic, relativistic, curvature-induced helical currents and the associated magnetic fields within chiral molecules. This four-current mechanism offers a self-contained explanation for the driving force underlying spin selectivity, independent of interfacial effects or unphysically enhanced spin–orbit coupling. Furthermore, our results provide a new perspective that offers a unifying framework with the potential to reconcile many existing hypotheses and theoretical models, while also suggesting several testable predictions that can be examined experimentally.},
