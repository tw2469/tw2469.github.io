abstract = {According to volcano curve describing suitable metallic centers for high catalytic activity, finely modulating electronic properties of metals by support is highly desired but often challenging in heterogenous catalysis due to the wide blank zone between two related supports in electronic property. In this work, we report that the support of N-doped carbon containing atomic copper sites, amongst supports of carbon or N-doped carbon, show the optimal modulation on nanoparticles of platinum, achieving highly electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotential of merely 20 mV at 10 mA cm−2, superior to that of commercial Pt/C. And the mass activity reaches 40.1 A mg-1Pt at 50 mV, much outperforming Pt/C and control sample without Cu. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the existence of atomic Cu-Nx sites contributes subtle changes to the interaction way between Pt and the support, resulting in Pt nanoparticles with finely tuned electronic properties and moderate affinity to the intermediate, corresponding to the summit of volcano curve, that efficiently facilitating the HER process.}
