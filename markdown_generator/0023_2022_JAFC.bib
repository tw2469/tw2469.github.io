    abstract = { Flavonoids, a class of polyphenolic substances widely present in the plant realm, are considered as ideal hypochlorite scavengers. However, to our knowledge, little study has focused on the structure–activity relationship between flavonoids and hypochlorite scavenging capacity. Herein, we report for the first time the three-dimensional quantitative structure and activity relationship (3D-QSAR) combined with comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA). Four models derived from CoMFA and CoMSIA with different combinations of descriptors were built and compared; the CoMFA model, which included both steric and electrostatic fields, showed great potential (R2 = 0.989; Q2 = 0.818) in predictive quality according to both internal and external validation criteria. Additionally, the average local ionization energy (ALIE), electrostatic potential (ESP), and orbital weighted dual descriptor (OWDD) were determined to identify the key structural moiety for scavenging capacity of flavonoids against hypochlorite. The computational results indicated that hypochlorous acid (HClO) serves as an electrophile undergoing electrophilic addition to the C6 carbon, which has the highest negative charge density, which are influenced by the functional groups on the flavones. The DFT calculated mechanism revealed the catalytic role of water of mono- and di-chlorination reactions, characterized by low activation barriers, and the involvement of neutral, instead of high-energy carbocation, intermediates. }
