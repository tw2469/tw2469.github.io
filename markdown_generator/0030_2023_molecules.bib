ABSTRACT = {Lead (II) (Pb(II)) is widespread in water and very harmful to creatures, and the efficient removal of it is still challenging. Therefore, we prepared a novel sponge-like polymer-based absorbent (poly(amic acid), PAA sponge) with a highly porous structure using a straightforward polymer self-assembly strategy for the efficient removal of Pb(II). In this study, the effects of the pH, dosage, adsorption time and concentration of Pb(II) on the adsorption behavior of the PAA sponge are investigated, revealing a rapid adsorption process with a removal efficiency up to 89.0% in 2 min. Based on the adsorption thermodynamics, the adsorption capacity increases with the concentration of Pb(II), reaching a maximum adsorption capacity of 609.7 mg g−1 according to the Langmuir simulation fitting. Furthermore, the PAA sponge can be efficiently recycled and the removal efficiency of Pb(II) is still as high as 93% after five adsorption–desorption cycles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal that the efficient adsorption of Pb(II) by the PAA sponge is mainly due to the strong interaction between nitrogen-containing functional groups and Pb(II), and the coordination of oxygen atoms is also involved. Overall, we propose a polymer self-assembly strategy to easily prepare a PAA sponge for the efficient removal of Pb(II) from water.},
