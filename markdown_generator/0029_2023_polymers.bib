ABSTRACT = {The facile preparation of non-noble metal nanoparticle loaded carbon nanomaterials is promising for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis. Herein, a facile preparation strategy is proposed to prepare nitrogen-doped carbon sponge loaded with fine cobalt nanoparticles by the direct pyrolysis of the cobalt ions adsorbed polymeric precursor. The polymeric sponge precursor with continuous framework and high porosity is formed by the self-assembly of a poly(amic acid). Taking advantage of the negatively charged surface and porous structure, cobalt ions can be efficiently adsorbed into the polymeric sponge. After pyrolysis, fine cobalt nanoparticles covered by carbon layers are formed, while the sponge-like structure of the precursor is also well-preserved in order to give cobalt nanoparticles loaded nitrogen-doped carbon sponges (Co/CoO@NCS) with a high loading content of 44%. The Co/CoO@NCS exhibits promising catalytic activity toward ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.830 V and a limiting current density of 4.71 mA cm−2. Overall, we propose a facile polymer self-assembly strategy to encapsulate transition metal nanoparticles with high loading content on a nitrogen-doped carbon sponge for efficient ORR catalysis.},
