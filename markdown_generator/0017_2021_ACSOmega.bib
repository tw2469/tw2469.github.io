    abstract = { The advent of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), which are easily synthesized, ultralow-cost materials and have an impeccable luminous efficiency, has drastically changed the future perspective of semiconductor quantum dot devices. Although the band gap energy of lead perovskite NCs can be tuned by the halide composition, the instability problem prevails for mixed-halide perovskite NCs, caused by phase segregation due to ion migration when an external electric field or light is applied. To avoid this problem and obtain the stable emission of RGB primary colors, in this study, two synthesis pathways of pure-halide perovskite NCs are proposed. One approach is the modified hot injection method with “centrifugation of a frozen eutectic mixture” to separate small NCs efficiently, and the other is the “low-temperature mixing and heat-up method” for target materials including CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, and CH(NH2)2PbBr3 (FAPbBr3). The emission wavelength of FAPbBr3 is tuned ion-stoichiometrically, unlike Cs perovskites. These various synthesis pathways of pure-halide perovskite NCs enable the efficient production of high-quality perovskite NCs and allow precise tuning of the emission color to the desired wavelength. Although there are still several “gaps” remaining in the available emission wavelength, the new methodology proposed in this study could potentially be employed for manufacturing more stable perovskite NC-based optoelectronic devices. }
