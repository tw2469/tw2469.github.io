abstract  ="Nitrogen-doped carbon materials with highly porous structures and interconnected ultrathin frameworks have shown outstanding features for electrocatalytic applications. Herein{,} we propose a self-assembly strategy to prepare nitrogen-doped carbon sponge (NCS) with high porosity{,} an ultrathin framework{,} and a high content of active nitrogen species for high performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by direct pyrolysis of the polymeric precursor. Amphiphilic poly(amic acid) (PAA) can self-assemble into a highly porous sponge-like structure (donated as PAA sponge). After pyrolysis{,} the high porosity and ultrathin framework of the PAA sponge are well inherited. The nitrogen species in the PAA sponge convert to pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen when pyrolyzed at 800 °C to give NCS-800{,} corresponding to an atomic percent of 4.6%{,} which are believed to be the origin of ORR catalytic activity. The NCS-800 shows high catalytic performance toward the ORR and superior methanol tolerance and long-term stability in comparison to Pt/C. After 30 hours{,} the relative current density is still as high as 92.4%{,} which is much higher than that of Pt/C (73.7%). This strategy can be extended to facilely prepare doped carbon materials with tailored morphologies and heteroatom species by choosing appropriate monomers from the abundant library of diamines and dianhydrides."}
