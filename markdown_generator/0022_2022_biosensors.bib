ABSTRACT = {For rapid and portable detection of ethylene in commercial fruit ripening storage rooms, we designed a smartphone-based optical fiber sensor (SOFS), which is composed of a 15 mW 365 nm laser for fluorescence signal excitation and a bifurcated fiber system for signal flow direction from probe to smartphone. Paired with a pyrene-tagged Grubbs catalyst (PYG) probe, our SOFS showed a wide linearity range up to 350 ppm with a detection limit of 0.6 ppm. The common gases in the warehouse had no significant interference with the results. The device is portable (18 cm × 8 cm × 6 cm) with an inbuilt power supply and replaceable optical fiber sensor tip. The images are processed with a dedicated smartphone application for RGB analysis and ethylene concentration. The device was applied in detection of ethylene generated from apples, avocados, and bananas. The linear correlation data showed agreement with data generated from a fluorometer. The SOFS provides a rapid, compact, cost-effective solution for determination of the fruit ethylene concentration dynamic during ripening for better fruit harvest timing and postharvest management to minimize wastage.},
